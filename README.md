# WP No Meta Duplicates!

Cleans up Wordpress database from any meta duplicates and prevents further occurrences.

### Usage

After activating the plugin, there is a special page added under Tools menu -> `Clean DB Duplicates`
Use it to cleanup the database from meta duplicates.

- Additionally you can activate the protection from such meta duplicates on certain WP DB tables.

> Note

-   A duplicate here is a meta entry with the same meta name and same meta value over the same post. Issue in WP is relevant
    to the fact WP does not control how many meta entries with the same name/post_id and value do you add. Therefore 
    garbage grows quite fast for bigger projects under WP.
