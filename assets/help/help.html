  <h3>Wetail No Duplicates</h3>
  <p>
    The plugin is meant to help in cleaning DB from any meta duplicates, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>User meta</li>
    <li>Post meta</li>
    <li>Term meta</li>
    <li>Order item meta</li>
    <li>Payment token meta</li>
    <li>Comment meta</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Before you launch any cleaning operation it is strongly advised to make a DB backup though all operations are
    totally fail-safe to run, because force-major cannot be predicted (as unexpected server shutdown).
  </p>

  <h3>Tables</h3>
  <p>In the list of tables it is recommended to clean only those which have more than 100 duplicates to not to run extra queries</p>
  <p>First - check the number of duplicates for all tables or for those which are suspected to have ones.</p>
</tab>
<tab>
  <h3>Triggers</h3>
  <p>
    Triggers will prevent further occurrences of duplicates in selected tables. Absolutely safe to call.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep in mind that it is useful to check DB for duplicates from time to time anyways.
